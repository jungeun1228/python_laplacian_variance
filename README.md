Image analysis: calculate laplacian variance to identify out-of-focus images and compare analysis results

Laplacian variance was calculated for individual images to identify out-of-focus ones.
Images were filtered based on a threshold in Laplacian variance, and the test results (red/green ratio) were compared before and after filtering.
